# GAN Training Loss Plotter

This script processes a `.csv` file containing training data from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and generates a plot visualizing the loss values over epochs. This can be useful for tracking training progress and evaluating model performance.

## Contents

- `plot_gan_loss.py`: The main script that reads in the `.csv` file and produces the plot.
- Example `.csv` file: An optional example file with dummy data for testing the script.

## Prerequisites

This script requires the following Python packages:

- `matplotlib` (for plotting)
- `pandas` (for data handling)

Install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas
```
